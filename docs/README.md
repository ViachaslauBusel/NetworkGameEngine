This is a framework for creating server-side game logic that allows you to write scripts without the need for manual data synchronization. All objects are isolated in separate threads, enabling load distribution and improving performance. Instead of locking data, objects interact through commands, simplifying state management and ensuring data safety. This framework is perfect for building scalable servers that can efficiently handle large numbers of players.

✅ State isolation — prevents data races and synchronization issues.<br>
✅ Scalability — easily distribute objects across threads.<br>
✅ Logic flexibility — commands allow you to change object behavior without breaking encapsulation.<br>
